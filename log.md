# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 0: January 09, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Implemented search in Hack ID Jekyll site

**Thoughts:** Started off from a tutorial (which I cited!), but there was work to do in styling the search results the way I wanted. Looks good! Last thing will be to style the search box in the navbar, so it doesn't break it.

## Day 1: January 10, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Finished and merged search feature in Hack ID site

**Thoughts:** Really pleased with the way it turned out. Also made some minor other updates. This marks my first merge by myself! Also learned to stash then apply stash to new branch in the case where I realize I need a new branch for saved but uncommited changes. See this stack overflow question [Git: Create a branch from unstaged/uncommited changes on master](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2569459/git-create-a-branch-from-unstaged-uncommited-changes-on-master).

## Day 2: January 11, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Made a PR for Oppia Issue

**Thoughts:** I dove straight back into the other open source project I contribute to, Oppia. It was a nice, small CSS issue (though it still caused me a bit of trouble), so I was able to make a PR today.

## Day 3: January 12, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Code Wars Kata Practice

**Thoughts:** I only finished one or two kata before getting stuck! I'd forgotten about Code Wars until I saw it in someone else's 100 Days of Code log. It's good for me to get back to practicing these sorts of things. I'm finding that my code is verbose when compared to many of the other solutions. I should probably take more time to look closely at them and try and copy their use of functions like map and slice.

## Day 4: January 13, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Code Wars Kata Practice

**Thoughts:** I only finished one kata today. It's really good to be discovering my limitations with algorithms. I need to practice even MOAR.

## Day 5: January 15, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Started Accessibility Audit and Another Tiny Game.

**Thoughts:** Missed yesterday :-( But, I realized that I really, really want to make the transition to developer. So I'll be starting technical interview practice soon! Today, I began a big accessibility audit for the Oppia project. My mentor there is awesome! I'm happy to improve my own knowledge with accessibility because I do think it's fundamental. Also, able to get back into game dev. I'm working on a tiny infinite scroller game with Phaser.

## Day 6: January 16, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Continued with accessibility audit and tiny game

**Thoughts:** Still working my way through my Supply run infinite scroller game. Having some serious trouble with sprite bodies and collision. But I did get the game to the point where it's starting to look right. Inspiration for the feel comes from jetpack joyride.

## Day 7: January 17, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Finished accessibility audit Oppia project, continued tiny game, and started on tech interview practice

**Thoughts:** Still working my way through my Supply run infinite scroller game. I'm slowly but surely fixing issues as they come up. However, I started on the interview Cake curriculum and I just keep realizing how much I stink at this. But I'm determined to start looking for that coding job in 3 months... I'm excited and freaked out!

## Day 8: January 18, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Continuing tech interview practice and tiny game

**Thoughts:** Started in earnest on the tech interview practice. I am SOOO frustrated! I feel stupid! It's not fun. On a positive note, I seem to have solved a niggling issue in my Supply Run infinite runner game.

## Day 8: January 19, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Continuing tech interview practice and tiny game

**Thoughts:** The Interview Cake flow is really good. Just as I was feeling frustrated, he sent an email that validates that feeling and encourages you to keep going. Also helps that I'm reading Thinking Fast and Slow and today's chapter was sorta about hacking your mind through system 1. So I got through one problem. Still having issues with my tiny game. I think I need to reorg the code and take it one step at a time. There are too many variables right now.

## Day 9: January 20, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Continuing tech interview practice and tiny game

**Thoughts:** I was (am) still feeling a bit stupid in terms of algorithms. But I did feel a bit better when I looked up Front-End developer interview questions and realized that the questions I was preparing for were more engineering focused. So I have a new study plan to prepare for front-end dev positions! I still think my algorithm practice needs to improve a TON. So part of my plan will be to stick to the two lower levels of CodeKata for the next couple of weeks. Then struggle back through to my current rank, while also continuing to go through the Interview Cake course, but with more of an eye towards learning instead of trying to solve it. I will say that, in today's practice, I incorporated several of the things I've learned so far in Interview cake about how to think through my solution and optomize for time and space effeciency.

I made several issues for my game to try and get better handle on what I'm trying to fix.
