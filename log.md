# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 0: January 09, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Implemented search in Hack ID Jekyll site

**Thoughts:** Started off from a tutorial (which I cited!), but there was work to do in styling the search results the way I wanted. Looks good! Last thing will be to style the search box in the navbar, so it doesn't break it.

## Day 1: January 10, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Finished and merged search feature in Hack ID site

**Thoughts:** Really pleased with the way it turned out. Also made some minor other updates. This marks my first merge by myself! Also learned to stash then apply stash to new branch in the case where I realize I need a new branch for saved but uncommited changes. See this stack overflow question [Git: Create a branch from unstaged/uncommited changes on master](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2569459/git-create-a-branch-from-unstaged-uncommited-changes-on-master).

## Day 2: January 11, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Made a PR for Oppia Issue

**Thoughts:** I dove straight back into the other open source project I contribute to, Oppia. It was a nice, small CSS issue (though it still caused me a bit of trouble), so I was able to make a PR today.

## Day 3: January 12, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Code Wars Kata Practice

**Thoughts:** I only finished one or two kata before getting stuck! I'd forgotten about Code Wars until I saw it in someone else's 100 Days of Code log. It's good for me to get back to practicing these sorts of things. I'm finding that my code is verbose when compared to many of the other solutions. I should probably take more time to look closely at them and try and copy their use of functions like map and slice.
