# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 0: January 09, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Implemented search in Hack ID Jekyll site

**Thoughts:** Started off from a tutorial (which I cited!), but there was work to do in styling the search results the way I wanted. Looks good! Last thing will be to style the search box in the navbar, so it doesn't break it.

**Link to work:** [Hack ID Repo](https://github.com/hackid/hackid.github.io/tree/search-box)
